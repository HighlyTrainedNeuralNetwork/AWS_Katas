Getting your dependencies into Lambda seems to be a hassle.
Potentially, the CLI makes this easy but I am ignoring that for now and doing everything manually.
Process allows you to import a zip file of your dependencies as a "Layer" which your function can then connect to.
The difficulty seems to be formatting said zip file correctly.
Resource I used that was ultimately successful was:
https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/lambda-import-module-error-python/
Though this involved spinning up a new Linux EC2 instance. This should be doable locally. At one point I saw a resource
that suggested doing it in a Docker container though I can't seem to find it anymore.
Other promising resources I found were:
This comprehensive video that described the process well but seems to produce a somehow incorrectly formatted zip file:

This StackOverflow post that describes the required format of the zip file, but I haven't been able to implement it:

I'm not sure that I tried this, but it seems like it might work well:

Directions of inquiry:
"create Lambda Python Layer from requirements.txt"
"create Lambda Python Layer in a Docker instance"
TODO Items:
-Interface with S3 storage for logging output
-Force authentication to access API
-Maybe build out a mini-frontend to interact without Postman (not really the point but can be fine refresher or can try
new frontend stack)
